# üçÖ Pomodoro App (Python) üçÖ

A simple pomodoro app using Python 3.9.2 and pip 24.2, it's also already packaged for MacOS  

What's a pomodoro? --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique


## How to Use
clone the repo or download the zip from the Github page (hint: green "Code" button)  
install the custom fonts in your system:  
>Go to the folder "*/fonts*" in the repository, double click each font and install them

#### With MacOs 

- via App file:  
The app is already packaged for MacOs, this means after cloning (or unzip) the repo, can go to the folder "*/dist*" and double-click the pomodoro app icon üçÖ.  
The app works for my current system: macOS 11.6.4 (20G417), other systems could give an issue.

#### With Python (Mac or Windows)
[Install python]([https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/))

- via python file:  
Can also start the app directly from the python file by running the code below, this requires using the terminal.
Open the terminal app and copy paste the code below.

#### For Windows
>change the working directory to the path where you unziped the app files
>```sh
>cd your/path/to/repo/Pomodoro-App-main
>```
>create a virtual environment for the app's libraries
>```sh
>python -m venv venv 
>```
>activate the virtual environment just created
>```sh
>venv\Scripts\activate
>```
>install the required libraries
>```sh
>pip install -r requirementsWin.txt
>```
>launch the app from the python file
>```sh
>python pomodoro.py
>```
#### For Mac
>change the working directory to the path where you unziped the app files
>```sh
>cd your/path/to/repo/Pomodoro-App-main
>```
>create a virtual environment for the app's libraries
>```sh
>python3 -m venv venv 
>```
>activate the virtual environment just created
>```sh
>source venv/bin/activate
>```
>upgrade pip and install the required libraries (also installs jupyter in case you want to play around with it)
>```sh
>python -m pip install --upgrade pip
>pip install -r requirementsMac.txt
>```
>launch the app from the python file
>```sh
>python pomodoro.py
>```
>Should work with the previous code, if there are permissions issue can try adding this to give executable permissions before launching the python file:
>```sh
>chmod +x pomodoro.py
>```

- via jupyter notebook:  
There is also a jupyter notebook in the repo used for development and testing. Can also launch the app by running the first code cell. The steps are the same as above but instead of launching the pomodoro.py file in the last step, launch jupyter instead:  

#### For Mac
>add the virtual environment to Jupyter kernel
>```sh
>python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv --display-name "Pomodoro Venv" 
>```
>open jupyter lab
>```sh
>jupyter lab
>```  
After the Jupyter lab opens can open the file "Pomodoro App testing.ipynb" and run the first cell with code by clicking on the cell and then Shift+Enter.

# To Do's 
( somewhere, sometime in the distant future.. or by the devine grace of a gentle soul that contributes their pen  
‡´ÆÍí∞ À∂‚Ä¢ ‡ºù ‚Ä¢À∂Íí±·Éê ‚ô° )

- Package the app to also work on windows,
- Open app by clicking on the terminal executable inside /dist (opens much faster),
- Auto adjust the background image to always match size of the window,
- Load the custom fonts from path, and remove the step to install them in the How to use instructions,

# Final Notes

When packaging the app i first tried with py2app, thats why there's a remnant setup.py file but this did not work, even troubleshooting and trying a lot of fixes did not work in creating a launchable app icon, even though it worked by launching from the terminal executable. Don't know if it has to do with my MacOs version or was doing something else wrong. The build time was also much longer than with pyinstaller, but with pyinstaller i had to adjust the pathing to the resources and add the images and sounds folder manually to the app.
