# üçÖ Pomodoro App (Python) üçÖ

A simple pomodoro app using Python 3.9.2 and pip 24.2, it's also already packaged for MacOS  

What's a pomodoro? --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique


## How to Use
clone the repo or download the zip from the Github page (hint: green "Code" button)

#### With MacOs 

- via App file:  
The app is already packaged for MacOs, this means after cloning (or unzip) the repo, can go to the folder "*/dist*" and double-click the pomodoro app icon üçÖ.  
The app works for my current system: macOS 11.6.4 (20G417), other systems could give an issue.

#### With Python
[Install python](https://www.python.org)
- via python file:  
Can also start the app directly from the python file (this requires using the terminal and having correct python and pip versions).
```sh
cd path/to/repo/Pomodoro_App # move to the directory with the app
python3 -m venv venv # create a virtual environment for this app's libraries
source venv/bin/activate # activate the venv just created
pip install -r requirements.txt # install all the requirements
python pomodoro.py # launch the app
```
    Should work with the previous code, if there are permissions issue can try adding this to give executable permissions:
```sh
...
chmod +x pomodoro.py # give permisison
python pomodoro.py # launch the app
```

- via jupyter notebook:  
There is also a jupyter notebook in the repo used for development and testing. Can also launch the app by running the first 2 cells:
```sh
cd path/to/repo/Pomodoro_App # move to the directory with the app
python3 -m venv venv # create a venv for this app libraries
source venv/bin/activate # activate the venv just created
pip install -r requirements.txt # install all the requirements
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv --display-name "Pomodoro Venv" # add the venv to Jupyter as a kernel
jupyter lab # open jupyter lab
```  
    After the Jupyter lab opens can open the file "Pomodoro App testing.ipynb" and run the first cell with code by clicking on the cell and then Shift+Enter.

# To Do's 
( somewhere, sometime in the distant future.. or by the devine grace of a gentle soul that contributes their pen ‡´ÆÍí∞ À∂‚Ä¢ ‡ºù ‚Ä¢À∂Íí±·Éê ‚ô° )

- Package the app to also work on windows,
- Open app by clicking on the terminal executable inside /dist (opens much faster),
- Auto adjust the background image to always match size of the window.
